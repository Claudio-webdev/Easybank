# Easybank
onepage site Easybank landing page with Middleman
This is the challenge https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/easybank-landing-page-WaUhkoDN
i used Middleman and i didn't download the Sketch design file so all the spaces are made by eye.
I Find pretty easy to use Middleman and in this case i didn't install webpack just to keep it easy to understand.

I will much appriciate if you leave a comment and if you have any questions about Middleman.
